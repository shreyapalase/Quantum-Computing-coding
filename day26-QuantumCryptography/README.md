# Quantum Cryptography
This folder contain material for implememnt and learn quantum Cryptography protocol for secure quantum communication.

In this we will learn:
- What is **Quantum Cryptography**
- Why classical cryptography is vulnarable?
- Core Idea of **Quantum Key distribution(QKD)**
- BB84 Protocol
- Implementing BB84 protocol using qiskit and AerSimulator
