# Introdcution to Quantum Computing

This folder contains modules focuses on basic introduction of what is qunatum computing comare with classical one.

---

## Learning Objective:
By the end of module ,you will be able to:

This notebook demonstrates a simple quantum program using Qiskit:
1. create a quantum circuit with 1 qubit.  
2. Apply Hadamard gate to create superposition.  
3. measure the qubit.  
4. Run the circuit on a simulator and visualize the result.
