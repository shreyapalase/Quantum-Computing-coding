# QAOA Implementation for Maxcut Problem
In this folder contain material for ,the **Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm(QAOA)** to solve the **Maxcut problem** on a simple graph using **Qiskit**.

In this,you will learn:
- Define graph for MaxCut problem
- Construct  the cost and mixer Hamiltonions
- Implement the QAOA circuit.
- Optimize parameters using a classical optimizer.
- Evaluate and visualize the result.

## Contents:
1. **day23_QAOAalgorithm.ipynb** 
this hands-on jupiter practice notebook which represent demonstration of working QAOA algorithm in Quantum Computing.

2. **day23_notes.md**
   this file include detailed theory notes on QAOA Algorithm well explained our implementation for more deep understanding.
