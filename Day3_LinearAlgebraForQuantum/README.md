#Day3 - Linera Algebra for Quantum computing

This Folder contains material to practice and understand linear algebra for quantum computing.

## contents -
1. **day3_linearAlgebraForQuantum.ipynb**
   this is hand on jupyter notebook which covers foloowinf topics:
   - Qubits as vectors
   - Bras and Kets
   - Inner product
   - Tensor product
