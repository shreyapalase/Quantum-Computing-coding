# Bell State circuit on IBM-style real Backend

this folder contain introduction Bell State circuit on IBM-style real Backend and demonstrate the creation and measurement of a bell state using Qiskit.
Simulations are performed using Aer simulator with optional noise models to mimic real IBM Quantum Hardware.
In this ,we will learn:
- Bell states and their significance
- Mathematical form of the Bell state ∣Φ+⟩
- Conceptual preparation of Bell state
- Measurement outcomes and probabilities
- Ideal vs real quantum hardware
- Introduction to quantum noise
- Depolarizing noise model
- Effect of depolarizing noise on Bell states
- Use of Aer simulator with noise
