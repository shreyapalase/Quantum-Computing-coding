   Final project report on  QAOA based energy efiicient satellite task scheduling under orbital visbility contraints.
   
## Project Overview

The project focuses on:
- Using **QAOA** to optimize task scheduling in energy-constrained orbital systems.  
- Comparing classical vs quantum approaches in terms of **energy efficiency** and **task feasibility**.  
- Addressing **orbital visibility constraints** to ensure tasks are scheduled only when satellites or orbiting platforms are visible.

These materials are intended to help understand how quantum algorithms can improve scheduling in energy-constrained space systems.
