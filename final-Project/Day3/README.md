### Day 3 
# QAOA-Based  Energy Efficient Satellite Task Scheduling Under Orbital Visibility Constraints

## Overview
This repository documents **Day 3 progress** of the project on **Energy-Efficient Satellite Task Scheduling using QAOA under Orbital Visibility Constraints**.  
The focus of this stage is **problem modeling and interpretation**, explaining *why constraint-aware optimization leads to Task T4 having the highest selection probability*, even though other tasks have higher nominal priority.

The work emphasizes **conceptual clarity, engineering reasoning, and interview readiness**, rather than low-level quantum computation details.
