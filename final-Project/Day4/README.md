### Day 4 
# QAOA Based Energy Efficient Task Scheduling Under Orbital Visibility Constraints


This folder contains material for **Day 4** of the project on **QAOA-based Energy Efficient Task Scheduling under Orbital Visibility Constraints**.

## Files

1. **Classical_vs_Quantum_Result_comparision.md**  
   Compares results from classical algorithms and the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) for energy-efficient task scheduling. Highlights differences in performance, efficiency, and solution quality.

2. **case_study.md**  
   Demonstrates a practical case study applying QAOA to schedule tasks under orbital visibility constraints. Includes setup, results, and insights.

## Project Overview

The project focuses on:
- Using **QAOA** to optimize task scheduling in energy-constrained orbital systems.  
- Comparing classical vs quantum approaches in terms of **energy efficiency** and **task feasibility**.  
- Addressing **orbital visibility constraints** to ensure tasks are scheduled only when satellites or orbiting platforms are visible.

These materials are intended to help understand how quantum algorithms can improve scheduling in energy-constrained space systems.
