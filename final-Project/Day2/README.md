### Day 2  
# QAOA-Based Energy-Efficient Satellite Task Scheduling Under Orbital Visibility Constraints

---

## Introduction

The **Day 2** folder contains the theoretical and research groundwork necessary to extend the satellite task scheduling problem from a **classical solution** to a **quantum optimization approach using QAOA**.  
All work is organized in **separate Markdown files**, clearly documenting each phase of the research and modeling process.

---

## Day 2 Goal (Short)

> **Formulate the satellite task scheduling problem into QUBO and Ising models suitable for QAOA, validated against the classical benchmark.**

---

## Classical Baseline Reference (Day 1)

The classical baseline provides the **optimal reference solution** under energy, priority, and visibility constraints, and is used throughout Day 2 for validation and comparison.

🔗 **Classical Baseline File:**  
`../Day1/Step2_problem_formation.md`

## Classical Baseline Files in This Project

This project includes the following classical scheduling artifacts used for validation and benchmarking:

- **`classical_result.md`**  
  Documents the final classical scheduling outcomes and optimal task selections per visibility window.

- **`classical_satellite_scheduler.py`**  
  Python implementation of the classical energy- and priority-aware satellite task scheduling algorithm.

- **`classical_baseline.ipynb`**  
  Interactive notebook demonstrating exhaustive search, cost evaluation, and result visualization for the classical baseline.
