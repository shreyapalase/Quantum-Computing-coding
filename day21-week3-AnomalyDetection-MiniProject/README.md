# MiniProject - Quantum-Assisted Anomaly Detection in Noisy Environment Sensor Networks
This Notebook demonstrate a noise -aware quantum workflow for detecting anomolies in environmental sensor data using entanglement ,
phase estimation anf grover search algorithm to study anomly dtection under realistic NISQ-Era condition.

### Project Goal :
the goal of this project was to simulate a realistic ,industry -relevant quantum workflow that can:
- Model Environmental sensor data
- Handle Noise and uncertainty
- Detect rare anomalous events
- operates under NISQ- era hardware limitation.

Rather than demonstrating ideal quantum algithms , the focus was on how quantum algorithms behave under noise ,
which is the key challage in today'd quantum industry.
