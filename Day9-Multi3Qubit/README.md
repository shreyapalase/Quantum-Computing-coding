# Multi-Qubit System in Quantum Computing Part -1( 2-Qubit Gates)

Previously We studied single qubit  gates. now this folder demonstrate implementation of 3-Qubit system.

---

## we studied following 3-qubit gates:
- Toffoli gate(CCX)
- controlled-SWAP(fredkin)gate
- CCZ gate
- Multi-Controlled rotations(CRX,CRY,CRZ,CU)
- Custom Unitary 3-Qubit Unitary gate

All simulates using **Qiskit Statevector**

## Contents:
1. **day9_Multi3Qubit.ipynb**
this hands-on jupiter practice notebook which represent demonstration of 3 Qubit system and its representation.

2. **day9_notes.md**
   this file include detailed theory note about the 3-Qubit gates  and its purpose.
