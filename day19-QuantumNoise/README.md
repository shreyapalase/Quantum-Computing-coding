# Quantum Noise Simulation with Qiskit AerSimulator.
this folder contain introduction of quantum noise simulation and how identify it by using qiskit.
In this ,we will learn:
- What is Quantum noise?
- Type of Quantum Noise?
- How to simulate noise using Qiskit AerSimulator.
- Compare **ideal simulation vs noisy simulation**
- Result and future Scope.

## Contents:
1. **day19_QuantumNoise.ipynb** 
this hands-on jupiter practice notebook which represent demonstration of working of Quantum noise simulation in Quantum Computing.

3. **day19_notes.md**
   this file include detailed theory note about Quantum noise and its type in both way i.e theoritical and practical point of view
   for more deep understanding.
