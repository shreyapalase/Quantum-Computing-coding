# Superdense Coding in Quantum Computing

This folder contain demonstration of Superdense Coding with practical and Theory concept.
Superdense coding is a quantum communication protocol that allows **2 Classical bits** to be transmitted using only **1 qubit**,
thank to shared entanglement.

---

In this notebook you will learn :
- The Theory behind superdense coding
- How entanglement enables faster -than-classical communication capacity.
- How to implement superdense coding using  **Qiskit AerSimulator**
- How to 2-bit message maps to quantum gates.
- How Bob decodes Alice's encoded qubit.
