# Grover's Algorithm : 2-Qubit Search
This folder contain the implementation for grover's search algorithm for **N=4 (2-Qubits)** to find the marked state.
we will:
1. Prepare an equal superposition
2. Apply the **oracle** (marking target state)
3. Apply the **Diffusion Operator**(Amplifier amplification)
4. Visualize amplitudes
5. Measure the result
