# Quantum Phase Estimation
This folder contain material for the Implementation and working of Quantum Phase Estimation.
In this,we will learn:
- What  **Quantum Phase estimation**  is?
- Why phase estimation is fundamantal subroutine for many quantum algorithms.
- How to implememt QPE step-by-step
- how to controlled unitaries encode phase information.
- Implements QPE for:
    - **single qubit rotation**(eigenvalue=phase of rotation)
- Why inverse QFT extract the encoded phase.
