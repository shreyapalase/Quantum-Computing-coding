# Multi-Qubit System in Quantum Computing Part -1( 2-Qubit Gates)

Previously We studied single qubit  gates. now this folder demonstrate implementation of 2-Qubit system.

---

## Leraning Objective:
at end of this module you are able to understand:
- CNOT Gate 
- SWAP /iSWAP gate
- CZ gate
- Controlled rotations(CRX,CRY,CRZ)
- Controlled H-Gate 
- Controlled Phase gate(CP gate)
- Custom Unitary 2-Qubit Unitary gate

All simulates using **Qiskit Statevector**

## Contents:
1. **day8_Multi2Qubit.ipynb**
this hands-on jupiter practice notebook which represent demonstration of 2 Qubit system and its representation.

2. **day8_notes.md**
   this file include detailed theory note about the 2-Qubit gates  and its purpose.
