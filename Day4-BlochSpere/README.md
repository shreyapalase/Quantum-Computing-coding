# Qubit and Bloch Sphere

This folder contains modules focuses on the fundamental building block of quantum computing : **Qubits** and their **Geometrical representation**

---

## Learning Objective:
By the end of module ,you will be able to:

- Represent qubit mathematically and geometrically.
- understand and visualize the **Superposition** and **Phase** using Bloch Sphere.
- Apply common quantum gate(X,Y,Z,H,Rx,Ry,Rz,P(φ)) and observe their effects.
- create custom qubit state.

---

## contents:
1. **day4_BlochSphere.ipynb**
   Intractive and hands-on practice jupyter notebook to understand working of Bloch Sphere.
2. **day4_notes.md**
   detailed conceptual notes of each point and step by step explanation.
