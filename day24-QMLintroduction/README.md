# Quantum  Machine Learning(QML)
this folder contain material for classical machine learning ideas can be implemented using quantum circuits. we focus on building a **simple Quantum Neaural Network(QNN)** for **binary classification** using only core Qiskit tools.

In this, we will:
- Understand thebasic idea of a Quantum Neaural Network
- Encode classical data into a quantum circuit
- Use trainable quantum parameters(variational circuits)
- Perform binary classification using expectation value.
- Implement a QNN **without installing any extra QML libraries**
