# Measurement and Probability
This Folder contain material for practice and understanding Basic Quantum Measurement and Probability.

---

 ### Learning Objective

- Qubit can be in superposition 
- Measurement collapse it to 0 or 1
- Probabilities come from amplitude
- More Measurement $\rightarrow$ better probability distribution
- you learned measurement in **Z-Basis** and **X-Basis**
