# Deautsch-Jozsa Algorithm

This folder contain demonstration of Deautsch-Jozsa Algorithm with practical and Theory concept.
implements the **Deautsch-Jozsa Algorithm** for **3-bit input** .The goal is distinguish whether an unknown oracle function $ {f(x)} $ is:

- **Constant** - outputs same value for all inputs ('0' or '1')
- **Balanced** - outputs '0' for half of inputs and '1' for the other half

The Algorithm solves this with **one** oracle query.

In this notebook you will learn :
- The Theory behind Deautsch-Jozsa Algorithm.
- How to implement Deautsch-Jozsa Algorithm using  **Qiskit AerSimulator**
- How to 3-bit input.
- implemetation of function Constant and Balanced.
