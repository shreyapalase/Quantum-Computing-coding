# Mini Project - Adaptive Quantum Message Router(AQMR)

a unique hybrid protocol combining teleporation,Superdense coding and Deaustch-Jozsa style oracle detection to route quantum message efficiently.
This creates somethong like **tiny Quantum Router** that decide how to send a message based on a quantum property rather than a classical condition.
**In this project we will implemented** :

1. Multi-Qubit Entangled State
2. Deutsch–Jozsa Style Oracle
3. Decision Logic Using Controlled Gates
4. Superdense Coding Protocol
5. Quantum Teleportation Protocol
6. Hybrid Quantum routing based on entanglement characteristics.

## Learning Objective:
By the end of module ,you will be able to:

- Undersatnd Superdense coding.
- hybrid entanglement.
- understand Teleporation.
- how Entanglememnt choose routing path for superdense coding or teleportation.
